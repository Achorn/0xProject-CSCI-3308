# 0xProject-CSCI-3308 "Recipe Finder"
## What does the Group Ox website do?
###### Welcome to our Software Development final project! We are Group Ox! Over the course of the semester, our group has been working hard to create a website. The link for the website is at the top of the GitHub page. To get started, create an account by inputting your email and a password. After your account has been created, users will be able to save a list of ingredients that they have on hand. The list will then be used to generate a list of recipes that contain the ingredients in the users list. Hope you enjoy!
###### In the repository you will find a milestone folder with all of the completed milestones from the semester. Web Crawler contains the python scripting for the web crawler itself used in scrapping information from Bonapetit's website. The folder labeled docs contains all of the code for the html of the website, the javascript for the website, bootstrap, as well as the CSS for the website. Some of the files outside of the folders in the main page of the repo are old versions of the code and also an excel where form where the scrapped information is being stored before being put into the firebase database.
